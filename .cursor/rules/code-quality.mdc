Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

## No Apologies
Never use apologies.

Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

## No Unnecessary Updates
Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.
