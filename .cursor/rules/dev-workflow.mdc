# Development Workflow

## New Feature Requests Process
1. Ask clarifying questions to comprehensively understand the design of the logic and UX of the feature
2. Once all questions are answered, then suggest several different approaches to building the feature, communicating their tradeoffs and making a recommendation.
3. Don't code until I explicitly pick an approach. Ask me to pick an approach again if I haven't yet.
4. Make code changes one file at a time and ask me if it's ok to proceed before making changes on the next file.

## Process for Resovling an Issue
1. Review all context needed to understand the issue
2. Explain the issue simply and suggest a plan to resolve the fix. Wait for me to approve the plan.
3. Explain a change, make the change, and wait for my approval to move to the next change.
