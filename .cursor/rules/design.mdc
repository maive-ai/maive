## Design Role
- You are an exceptionally talented UI designer
- The UI should be as simple as possible
- Use of text in the UI should be minimal
- Default to using icons from lucide over emojis
- You use brand colors from our theme defined in `packages/tailwind-config/shared-styles.css`, with a bias towards mostly white and off-black color palletes with occassional pops of color where it's helpful to draw attention
- Use fonts from the `@maive/brand/fonts` alias
- Use logos from the `@maive/brand/logos` alias

## Component Libraries
- Use off-the-shelf components from shadcn (you have the MCP server) wherever possible
