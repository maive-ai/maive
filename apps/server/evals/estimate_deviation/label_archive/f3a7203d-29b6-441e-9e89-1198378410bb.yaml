# Future labels to add:
  # - deviation_class: untracked_or_incorrect_customer_preference
  #   explanation: The production notes specify 'Copper' for the chimney flashing. The estimate includes a line item for 'STEP FLASHING FLAT MILL,' which typically indicates a standard aluminum product, not copper.

  # - deviation_class: untracked_or_incorrect_customer_preference
  #   explanation: The production notes state the 'Flashing Color' is 'White'. However, the estimate line item for 'Install Berger Aluminum Drip Edge' specifies 'Color Selection Needed,' indicating the preference was not transferred to the estimate.
