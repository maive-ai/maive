"""
Abstract base classes for CRM providers.

This module defines the abstract interface that all CRM providers
must implement, ensuring consistent behavior across different CRM systems.

The interface is designed around universal CRM primitives (jobs, contacts, notes)
that work across all providers, with provider-specific data stored in the
provider_data field of each universal schema.
